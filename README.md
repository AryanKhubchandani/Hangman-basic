# Hangman-basic
Tried this basic program of Hangman. The program gives you a random word from the category selected by the player and the player tries to guess what it is using one letter at a time and has six lives. There are equivalent number of dashes to the number of letters in the word. If the player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the program fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the program reduces the number of lives by one. The number of incorrect guesses before the game ends is up to the players, but if the player gives six wrong answers, the game ends. If the player guesses the correct answer, he/she wins.
